      <h2>About Cannon Cove</h2>

      <p>
        Cannon Cove is a picturesque island located roughly 25 nautical miles off the northeast coast of Puerto Rico. Known for its turquoise waters, lush tropical forests, and colonial-era lighthouse perched on its cliffs, Cannon Cove has long been a hidden gem among Caribbean travelers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before disaster struck, the island boasted a thriving local community of about 8,000 residents. Fishing, tourism, and artisanal crafts were the lifeblood of the local economy. Colorful festivals, music echoing through cobblestone streets, and the scent of tropical flowers once defined Cannon Cove’s vibrant identity.

      <h2>The Arrival of Hurricane Eos</h2>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508610048659-a06b669e02d8?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1470&q=80" alt="Hurricane approaching Cannon Cove">
      <p>
        On the night of September 12th, Hurricane Eos—a Category 5 storm with sustained winds of 175 mph—made a direct hit on Cannon Cove. Few storms in recorded history have matched Eos in ferocity. Meteorologists described the cyclone as “an atmospheric monster,” with a pressure drop so steep it created towering waves exceeding 30 feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Residents hunkered down as the island was battered relentlessly. Torrential rains fell in sheets, the ocean surged over the low-lying beaches, and winds shredded roofs, snapped trees like matchsticks, and reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble. Power lines tangled in flooded streets, and communication towers toppled, severing contact with the outside world for over 48 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local emergency shelters overflowed, and scenes of panic were widespread. Many who could not reach higher ground found themselves trapped as seawater swept through downtown areas. Entire fishing fleets were destroyed, and boats were tossed inland like toys.

      <h2>The Flood Aftermath and Human Cost</h2>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603169922875-3d3f33f3e8e1?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1470&q=80" alt="Flood damage aftermath">
      <p>
        In the days following Hurricane Eos, aerial surveys painted a grim portrait: Cannon Cove was nearly unrecognizable. Over 80% of homes sustained damage or were completely flattened. Drinking water was contaminated. The port—a crucial lifeline for supplies—lay in ruins.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the true tragedy lay in the human toll. Dozens were confirmed dead, with hundreds more missing amid the rubble and flooded streets. Families searched desperately for loved ones, combing through collapsed buildings and debris. Many local traditions, historical sites, and centuries-old archives were lost forever beneath mudslides or swept out to sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mental health impact was profound. Survivors described overwhelming grief and trauma. Children struggled with nightmares and fear of rain. Aid organizations rushed in supplies, but logistical challenges slowed relief. Recovery efforts continue months later, and Cannon Cove’s future remains uncertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a partial list of missing individuals compiled by local authorities in the aftermath of the storm:
